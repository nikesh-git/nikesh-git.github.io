  <H1> Motivation Behind Journal </H1>

  <p>
    I like to think myself as a being of routines. Any day i would love to follow my routines over anything else even vacations.
    Feeling of growth and challenge is kind of my drug.

  <p>
    From an early age i love to read, write and make art. Grew up watching POGO MAD (:

    Life happens and throws you off the routines you love. There are many human behaviors that are tough to decode and tend to dominate life from the back seat.
  <ul>
    <li>Alcohol</li>
    <li>Entertaining Content: byte size and series size</li>
    <li>Sense of organisation and security: medical sevices, housing</li>
    <li>FOMO</li>
    <li>Greed</li>
    <li>Community</li>
  </ul>

    Most of these behaviors are primal and core to being a human. They are vital to person and hence can be used as a carrot and control individuals with fake promises.
    The capitalist society is based on such exploitable human behaviors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Actually if i think at the level of masses, this is not something new. There has been empires built that tap into human behaviors like entertainment, dopamine pumping shit to kill the thinking capacity of the mass population.
    The concept that providing the populace with basic needs and entertainment ("bread and circuses") can prevent them from thinking critically and potentially lead to a loss of independent thought is deeply rooted in Roman history and political philosphy.
