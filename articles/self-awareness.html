<H1>Self Awareness kicked out of window(screen)....</H1>
<p>
I am 90s kid. That means i have witnessed the transition of society towards digitization and attention economy. </br>
Its fairly accepted fact that a huge proportion of population is addicted for byte size content. Even the fingers seem to have developed muscle memory of mindless scrolling.</br>
Its not uncommon to witness people scrolling with one hand while eating with the other. And some can't even poop without consuming content.
</p>

<p>
Everyones aware of the effects of doom-scrolling. But as it has been my approach for life is to focus more on good over garbage. </br>
Through this writing i want to focus on the acts of self-awareness.</br>
<b>Que.</b>What it was like before social media? </br>
<b>Ans.</b> Contemlation...lots of contemplation...about self </br>

People would have to look for escapes to stop thinking and since it used to take work to find escapes, it was naturally throtled introducing a sweet and healthy balance. </br>
You would have to socialize, get out of your house, play etc. to escape.
</p>

<p>
In present, we all have a palm size escape in our pockets loaded with apps that grab your brain by the throat and strangle it to sleep.
</p>

<p>
It feels amazingly stable to have some self-awareness and able to devote time and mental energy contemplating about oneself.
