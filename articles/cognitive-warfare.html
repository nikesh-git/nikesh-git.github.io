  <H2>Make the enemy visible. It's difficult to fight an invisible enemy, so if can't see the cognitive enemy atleast define its blows and damage:</H2>
  <ul>
    <li> Define work boundaries and don't carry the work outside office hours. Every boundary work crosses is a defeat. </li>
    <li> Quantify work and its impact. Remember economy is fueled by impact of work not the work itself. </li>
  </ul>
